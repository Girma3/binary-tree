# binary-tree
- This is solution for [Binary tree](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees#assignment)
 - This binary search tree has these methods
   - buildTree - accept array and build binary search tree.
   - insert - accept value and add to the tree.
   - deleteItem - remove node from the tree.
   - find - accept value and find that node in the tree.
   - depth - accept node and return the depth of that node.
   - height - accept node and return the height.
   - inorder, preorder, postorder, levelorder - traversal methods that return array in a given order.
   - isBalanced - check the tree is  balanced or not return boolean.
   - rebalance - rebalance a tree if it is unbalanced.
 - The scropt can run in node using (node tieit.js). 
# what I learned 
- how to create binary search tree, it is fast for searching , insertion and deletion.
# continued development
- use binary tree in projects efficently.
# helpful resource
- this helped me to understand about depth and height in tree (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/height-and-depth-of-a-node-in-a-binary-tree/)
- this helped me to understand about traversal tree (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_UDUj1j1KQ&t=1s)
